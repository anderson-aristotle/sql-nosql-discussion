# Discussion: Relational and Non-relational Databases

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
- List three strengths of relational databases.
- List three strengths of non-relational databases.

## Introduction

You should have read the following:

- [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
- [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/)
- [Why You Should Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

Take five minutes to review these readings. Just skim to refresh your memory.
Then, take fifteen minutes to share your notes with your team and to
prepare for discussion. Discuss with each other and attempt to answer the
questions in the following section.

## Discussion

1. According to Sarah Mei, what are the benefits of using MongoDB?
1. Why wasn't MongoDB a good fit for the project she was developing?
1. What should you consider when choosing MongoDB or a relational database like
    Postgres?
1. Suppose you were building a blog with comments. Should a comment on one
    article appear on any other article? Will you ever view comments apart from
    their article?
1. Suppose this blog also had tags. Should tags appear on multiple articles?
    Which is the "parent" relation?
1. Contrast the direction of "ownership" between blog posts and comments, and
    blog posts and tags.
1. Suppose you had to edit a tag. In a relational database, how many rows need
    to be changed (best and worst case)? In a document database, how many
    documents need to be changed (best and worst case)?

## Compare & Contrast

Put together a list of similarities and differences between relational and
non-relational databases. You can start with comparisons provided by specific
vendors, such as the one found in [NoSQL Databases
Explained](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained). You might wish to organize
your thoughts with a [Venn diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram)
or a series of tables.

## Additional Readings

Pick an additional reading to go through with a classmate. Reflect on how the
article changes the discussion. What have you learned?
